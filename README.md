I designed a simple website using node.js as backend env, mongo db as a database.
The website takes a http get request from the client and send back the student data.
This project aims to apply dockerfile to build a node image, docker compose to run multiple containers together and using aws elastic beanstalk to deploy. also I use github actions to create ci/cd pipelines
